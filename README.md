# Teachers Calendar

This webapp was built for teachers at Yorkville High School. The primary feature is that you can easily transfer one years data, 
which may include class plans, links, and lecture notes from one year to the next, automatically skipping over scheduled days off, weekends, etc.

This webapp is still in use at http://calendar.yhscs.us/
